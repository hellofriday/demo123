# Channel 

Any product that integrates with a .bit registration service can be called a Channel. Channes often have their own user base and can drive traffic to .bit. By integrating a registrar's registration service into their product, they can earn channel rewards. [View Reward Details](build-together.md).

A typical channel is a decentralized wallet, which can integrate .bit within a few simple steps. [wallet integration with .bit](../developers/wallet-integration.md).
